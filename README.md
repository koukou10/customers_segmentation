# Customers_segmentation
The goal of this project is to understand the different types of users through their behavior over time, in order to detect the most likely to purchase.

### 3 parts : 
- Cleaning and Exploratory analysis
- Feature engineering and clustering
- Classification 

### The main algorithms implemented : 
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
- K-means
- Random Forests Clasifier (RFC)
- Gradient Boosting Clasifier (GBC)
- eXtreme Gradiengt Boosting Clasifier (XGBC)

### Result:
Excellent accuracy score for the final classification model (Gradient Boosting (target variable:Customer_Category_km13 )) : 0.987
